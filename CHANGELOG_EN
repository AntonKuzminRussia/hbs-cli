 Output logging into database added, all write in table `logs`
 Integration with finder.insidepro.com added. See docs.
 Dict for hybride attacks sort after compile
 Hashlists load in db with console mysqlimport tool
 Work task will not start if other work tasks with same alg parsing outfile or wait outfile parse.
 Fixed commons hashlists (by alg_id) bug then HBS try delete hashes of not exists hashlist
 Fixed commons hashlists (by alg_id) bug then busy of alg (it parsing or wait parsing) checked only if common hashlist already exists
 Fixed commons hashlists (by alg_id) bug then count of hashes getted by hashes, not summs
 Fixed commons hashlists (by alg_id) bug then salt lists loading with errors
 Fixed priority bug, when task with low priority can`t go to work while more priority task in outfile parsing process
 Ð¡ommon hashlists (by alg_id) not building if results of brute of this alg now parsing
 Fixed results parser bug with wrong work task status then it have no results
v0.2a:
 Out-files not remove from HDD and DB after parsing
 Fixed UTF8 passwords bug in already founded hashes procedure
 Forbidden hashlists delete which in work now
 Fixed dict delete bug (file was not deleted with dict db record)
 Fixed bug of 0 priority when user cancel priority set dialog
 Possibility set negative priority to work task
 Statistics of hashes grouped by algs
 Hide done task possibiliry (web-interface)
 User can select status of work task when create it (no always stopped after create)
 Fixed \r bug in hashlists
 Common hashlists (internal) building by algs
 Hashlist load process moved to single thread (search duplicates, put in db, etc)
 Hashlists get 'status' field. Work task by it may be created after hashlist parsed and has ready to work status.
 When new hashlist loading, hashes of it search in already exists hashlists for early found passwords
 Hashcat results parsing moved to single thread. This allow start new work task immediately after current work task done
 Search found hashes in other hashlists in system with same alg
 Script cron.py renamed on hbs.py
 Hashes load in database by LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE construction
